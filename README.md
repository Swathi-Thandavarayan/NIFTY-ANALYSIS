# NIFTY-ANALYSIS
### Description (500 words)
I created a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard using Nifty stock market data from 2000 to 2021. This dashboard is designed to provide an intuitive and detailed analysis of market trends and fluctuations, catering to both high-level and granular insights into stock performance over two decades.

The dashboard features a clean and user-friendly layout that emphasizes easy navigation and data slicing capabilities. At its core is an **interactive line chart** that visualizes the **Open, Close, High, and Low (OHLC)** prices of Nifty over time. The graph dynamically updates when different time filters or company selections are applied, offering a seamless experience in exploring how stock values evolved during various periods.

Users can slice and dice the data using several filters, including **Date**, **Company**, **Year**, **Month**, and **Quarter**. The **Date** filter enables a comprehensive analysis of stock performance across the entire time range, from the start of the millennium to the close of 2021. The **Company** filter allows users to focus on individual firms, making it easy to compare their trends and understand company-specific patterns or anomalies. The **Year** and **Month** filters provide a zoomed-in view, perfect for understanding the impact of short-term events, while the **Quarter** filter helps observe seasonal trends or earnings-related fluctuations.

The **Open, Close, High, and Low values** are presented in a visually appealing manner, with color coding to distinguish between each value. The **High and Low markers** are accentuated, making it straightforward to identify periods of extreme volatility or notable highs and lows in the market. The graph also highlights **critical turning points** in the stock values, adding context to financial trends. A tooltip feature is incorporated, displaying additional details, such as exact dates and price values, when hovering over the data points, making the information more accessible and insightful.

In addition to the OHLC chart, the dashboard includes **summary metrics** that provide a snapshot of key performance indicators, like average monthly closing price, highest highs, and lowest lows over specific time frames. This component helps users quickly grasp the overall market direction without needing to analyze the graph in detail.

To ensure the dashboard is both informative and engaging, **visual elements** such as color-coded signals and clean data cards are used to draw attention to significant trends or outliers. The layout is optimized for both novice users who seek basic information and seasoned investors looking for detailed analyses. 

Overall, this Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for understanding and exploring Nifty market trends over 21 years, making it suitable for financial analysts, stock market enthusiasts, and investors.
